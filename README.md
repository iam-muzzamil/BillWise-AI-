# 🧾 BillWise AI – Understand Your Bills Smarter  

## 📌 Overview  
Every month, millions of people receive their electricity, gas, water, or internet bills and feel confused.  

- Why is the bill so high this month?  
- What are these hidden charges and taxes?  
- How can I reduce my next bill?  

**BillWise AI** is a simple but powerful AI agent that helps you make sense of your utility bills. Just upload a picture or PDF of your bill, and the agent will:  
- Explain your bill in plain language (Urdu/English/local).  
- Highlight hidden charges and late fees.  
- Suggest money-saving tips (like shifting usage hours or changing packages).  

Because understanding bills shouldn’t be rocket science. 🚀

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
Bills are **universal and recurring** – everyone gets them, every month. Yet most people either:  
- Don’t understand them.  
- End up overpaying without knowing why.  
- Waste hours calling customer service.  

This is an **underrated problem** that no big company or startup is solving properly. That’s why we are building **BillWise AI**.
